# 📁 tabby-better-sidebar-plus

**Enhanced connection sidebar for [Tabby](https://tabby.sh)** — pinned
favourites, live connection status, drag & drop, and a contextual SFTP browser
living *inside* the sidebar rather than in a separate docked panel.

## Fork provenance and additions

This repository is an independent fork of
[TooMuhtsh/tabby-better-sidebar](https://github.com/TooMuhtsh/tabby-better-sidebar).
The original sidebar and its existing feature set come from that upstream
project; this fork retains that work and adds:

- A Linux system-information view for SSH sessions.
- Optional SFTP tracking of the terminal's current directory, with the user's
  choice remembered across restarts.
- A setting to hide Tabby's native SFTP toolbar button and the SFTP+ replacement
  button, when that plugin is installed.

The upstream MIT license and third-party notices are retained. This fork is
maintained independently and is not an official upstream release.

**Compatibility:** We do not recommend enabling this fork alongside the
upstream `tabby-better-sidebar` plugin because their sidebar and SFTP controls
overlap.

Tabby ships a native profile sidebar, but it is not exported for third-party
plugins to reuse. The upstream project reconstructs it; this fork keeps that
base and the features described below.

**Every block is independent, and each one can be switched off** from the
plugin's settings tab — if you never use SSH tunnels or workspaces, turn those
two off and the sidebar gets that much lighter. Nothing is deleted when you do:
your favourites, workspaces and snippets stay exactly where they are, they just
stop being displayed.

## 🧩 Better Tabby compatibility

This fork retains the integration contract used by the upstream
[tabby-better-vault](https://github.com/TooMuhtsh/tabby-better-vault) plugin to
share a single **Better Tabby** settings tab. The projects remain independent:
neither requires the other, with no shared code or npm dependency.

| | Plugin | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| 📁 | **tabby-better-sidebar-plus** *(this fork)* | Pinned favourites, live connection status, drag & drop, workspaces, contextual SFTP browser |
| 🔐 | **[tabby-better-vault](https://github.com/TooMuhtsh/tabby-better-vault)** | Automatic vault unlock via your OS keychain |

When both are installed, they elect one plugin to host the shared tab and each
renders its own settings page inside it. Install either one alone and it keeps
its own settings tab. The integration is only the small string contract
(`BetterPanelContribution:<id>`); there is no shared code or npm dependency.

## ✨ The profile tree

- **Pinned favourites**, for both profiles and folders
- **Live connection status** per profile, with an optional latency indicator —
  a timed SFTP round trip on the session's own channel, not an ICMP ping, so it
  measures the delay you actually feel when typing
- **Active sessions** section at the top, one row per pane rather than per tab,
  with uptime, a click to focus and a shortcut to that session's SFTP view
- **System information** follows the focused SSH session and shows live Linux
  CPU, memory, swap, processes, per-interface network rates and local filesystems
- **Recent profiles** — the five most recently launched, all types together
  (off by default)
- **Drag & drop** reordering — profiles and folders, including moving a profile
  between folders and re-parenting a folder
- **Workspaces**: hide profiles and folders per workspace (personal / work /
  project), each with its own favourites, its own sibling order, its own icon
  and an optional contextual colour; a tabs-or-dropdown selector, and one-click
  JSON export/import
- **Multiple selection**, for acting on several profiles at once
- **SSH tunnels**: a panel of what Tabby is currently forwarding, badges on the
  profiles that declare tunnels, and a modal to add, edit or remove them —
  including a memory of tunnels a dropped session failed to bring back
- **Quick filter bar**, searching name, description, host and username —
  including inside what a workspace currently hides
- **Right-click menus**, grouped into `Manage` and `More` submenus so they stay
  short: create and delete folders and profiles, clone a profile, rename, pick
  an icon, attach snippets and notes, share a folder, hide it in the current
  workspace

## 🎨 Icons

The icon picker searches three sources at once, entirely offline — no network
call is ever made:

- **Font Awesome**, the set Tabby itself uses
- **[Iconify](https://iconify.design)** Material Design Icons and Tabler, for
  generic glyphs
- **[dashboard-icons](https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons)** —
  around 2 400 logos of self-hosted services (Proxmox, Pi-hole, Nextcloud and
  the like), far more telling than a generic glyph for naming a real estate of
  machines. Icons that ship several palettes offer them as small dots on their
  tile, so a dark logo can be swapped for its light variant on a dark theme.

Recently used icons stay at hand, any icon can be pinned as a favourite with a
right click, and custom SVGs can be imported (sanitised with
[DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)).

The two large icon collections are loaded **on the first search only**, in a
separate bundle, so they cost nothing at startup.

## 📂 SFTP

The browser replaces the profile tree in the sidebar's own space and follows
whichever SSH tab has focus — each tab remembers where it was, and the view can
be **frozen** on one session so it stops following the focused tab.
An optional toolbar button follows the terminal's reported working directory;
turn it off to browse independently. The remote shell must report its current path.

When directory tracking is on, it also follows the terminal's current working
directory. The crosshair button beside Refresh switches tracking on or off.
Choosing a breadcrumb pauses tracking so the selected folder stays open;
right-clicking the breadcrumb copies the complete remote path.

- **Configurable columns** (size, date, octal and long permissions, type,
  extension), folders-first sorting, hidden files toggle, zebra striping
- **Multiple selection**, files *and* folders, for bulk delete and move
- **Chunked loading** of large directory listings
- **Double-click opens a file in a code editor**, never through the OS file
  association — so double-clicking an executable edits it instead of running it.
  Saving sends the file back automatically, checking first that the remote copy
  has not changed in the meantime, and restoring its permissions afterwards.
  Symbolic links are resolved, so it is the target that gets edited, not the
  link
- **"Open with…"** stays available, but only from the context menu
- **Create, rename and delete** entries — `Delete` key included, with an HTML
  confirmation whose default button you choose in the settings
- **Move entries** by dragging them onto a folder — a server-side rename,
  nothing transits
- **Drag a file out to the OS**: the download starts when you drop it, wherever
  you dropped it
- **Transfer manager** at the bottom of the sidebar — progress, speed, ETA and
  elapsed time per transfer, an arrival check that flags a copy that did not
  land whole, cancel confirmation, visible from both views, hidden when empty
- **Optional auto-refresh** of the listing, off by default
- **Auto-return** to the profile view once no tab has an active SFTP session

## 🖥️ System information

The sidebar view follows the focused SSH session. It shows Linux uptime and load,
CPU and memory use, swap, the busiest processes, a short history of network
traffic per interface, and mounted local filesystems. It refreshes every two
seconds and runs as a read-only SSH command on a separate channel, without
installing a remote agent or writing into the interactive terminal. Linux
`/proc`, `ps` and `df` are required.

## 📝 Snippets, notes and sharing

- **Snippets** — a command written once, attached to a profile, a folder, or
  everything, and reusable wherever it is attached. Supports `{{name}}`
  placeholders (required) and `{{name=default}}` (pre-filled), inherits down
  the folder tree, and can be set to write into the terminal, write and press
  Enter, or launch the session first
- **Notes** — a free-form memo per profile or folder, with a badge in the tree
- **Share a folder** through the clipboard, as JSON, at two levels: *with*
  connection details for your own machines, or *without credentials* for
  someone else. Passwords, login scripts, proxy commands and vault key
  references never travel, at either level; what was removed is stated in the
  notice, and the JSON is re-checked field by field when pasted back

## 🌍 Languages

The interface follows Tabby's language — English, plus French, Spanish,
German and Simplified Chinese, covering the whole plugin: profile tree, context
menus, active sessions and tunnels, SFTP browser, dialogs, transfers and the
settings tab. Any other locale falls back to English.

## Elsewhere

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> inserts a line break in the terminal instead
  of submitting
- A dedicated settings tab under Tabby's own settings (shared as **Better
  Tabby** when the vault plugin is also installed)

## 📦 Installation

**Requires Tabby 1.0.231 or newer** — developed and tested against **Tabby
1.0.235**.

In Tabby, open **Settings → Plugins**, search for `better-sidebar-plus` and install
it, then restart Tabby completely.

<details>
<summary>With npm directly</summary>

```bash
# In Tabby's plugin directory: %APPDATA%\tabby\plugins on Windows,
# ~/.config/tabby/plugins on macOS/Linux
npm install tabby-better-sidebar-plus
```

Then restart Tabby completely.

</details>

## ⚙️ Configuration

Everything lives in **Settings → Better Sidebar** (or **Better Tabby → 📁
Sidebar** if `tabby-better-vault` is also installed), split into *General*,
*Features* and *Snippets*. On disk, the settings sit under `sidebarPlus` in
Tabby's own `config.yaml`.

<details>
<summary>Every setting, with its default</summary>

**Blocks** — each one switches on independently:

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Shows the sidebar. Off, it disappears without uninstalling anything; this settings page stays reachable |
| `showActiveSessions` | `true` | Open SSH connections, at the top of the sidebar |
| `showRecentProfiles` | `false` | The five most recently launched profiles |
| `showTunnels` | `true` | Port forwarding panel and badges on the profiles |
| `showWorkspaces` | `true` | Workspace bar above the list |
| `showFilter` | `true` | Search field and its shortcut |
| `showSftp` | `true` | The SFTP tab of the sidebar and its panel |
| `showSystemInfo` | `true` | The Linux system information tab of the sidebar |
| `showTransfers` | `true` | Transfer manager at the bottom of the sidebar |
| `showSnippets` | `true` | The *Snippets* entry of the right click and its tab |
| `showNotes` | `true` | The *note* entry of the right click and its badge |

Turning a block off also stops its background work — no tab scanning, no
latency probe, no transfer tracking for a panel nobody is looking at.

**Behaviour:**

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `hideNativeTransfersMenu` | `true` | Hides Tabby's own transfers menu, which shows the same transfers |
| `hideNativeSftpButton` | `false` | Hides Tabby's built-in and SFTP+ buttons from SSH terminal toolbars |
| `workspaceSelectorMode` | `tabs` | Workspace bar as tabs, or as a dropdown list |
| `pingIntervalSeconds` | `0` | Latency probe interval; `0` disables it |
| `sftpAutoRefreshSeconds` | `0` | Re-reads the current folder on a cycle; `0` disables it |
| `sftpAutoReturnToProfiles` | `true` | Returns to the profile view when no SSH session is open any more |
| `sftpFollowTerminalDirectory` | `true` | Remembers whether the SFTP view follows the terminal's current directory |
| `sftpEditorPath` | *(empty)* | Program opened on double-click. Empty, Windows decides |
| `sftpDeleteDefaultButton` | `cancel` | Which button <kbd>Enter</kbd> activates in the SFTP delete confirmation |
| `sftpDragOutFolders` | `false` | Allows dragging a *folder* out to the OS, not just a file |
| `sftpColumns` | `size`, `date`, `mode` | Columns shown in the SFTP listing |
| `sftpFoldersFirst` | `true` | Sorts folders before files |
| `sftpShowHidden` | `true` | Shows dot-files |
| `sftpColumnBorders` | `true` | Column separators in the listing |
| `sftpZebra` | `true` | Alternating row background |

Your favourites, workspaces, snippets, notes, custom icons and orderings are
stored under the same key. They are data, not settings, and nothing here
deletes them.

## ⚠️ Known limitations

- **Remote editing has no locking.** The plugin checks that the remote file has
  not changed before sending your edit back, and refuses to overwrite if it
  has — but two people editing the same file at the same time is still last
  one wins.
- **Dragging out to a target that does not understand a deferred file offer**
  (Windows Terminal, MobaXterm) does nothing at all, silently. The source
  cannot detect it.
- **A profile shared through the clipboard keeps its host and port.** That is
  deliberate — it is what makes the folder useful — but it means the JSON
  describes your network. Use *Copy without credentials* when that matters.
- **Local shell profiles are never shared**: their options are a command to
  execute, which is precisely what should not arrive through a clipboard.

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wzwwzb/tabby-better-sidebar-plus
cd tabby-better-sidebar-plus
npm install --ignore-scripts   # avoids postinstall steps that build native code needlessly here
npm run watch
```

Then, with Tabby closed, link the folder into Tabby's plugin directory. Do not
use the `TABBY_PLUGINS` environment variable — it is broken on Windows:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "$env:APPDATA\tabby\plugins\node_modules\tabby-better-sidebar-plus" -Target "<path-to-this-folder>"
```

Restart Tabby completely after any rebuild — reloading the window is not enough,
since Tabby's plugin loader state is global to the process.
