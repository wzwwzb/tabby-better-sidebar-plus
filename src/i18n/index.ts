/**
 * Plugin UI translations, grafted onto Tabby's own mechanism.
 *
 * Same design as tabby-better-vault's I18nService — the contract is
 * DUPLICATED between the Better plugins, like betterPanel.ts, never shared
 * through an npm import. The hard-won rules it encodes (all measured on the
 * vault, see its src/i18n/index.ts for the full rationale):
 *
 * - Tabby already mounts `TranslateService` (ngx-translate) and re-exports it
 *   from `tabby-core` — verified in the compiled bundle there. The
 *   `| translate` pipe reaches our templates through TabbyCoreModule, which
 *   src/index.ts already imports. No dependency to add.
 * - `@ngx-translate/core` is NOT a dependency of this project and must never
 *   become one: it is bundled INSIDE tabby-core and does not exist as a
 *   resolvable module at runtime — an external import would be a dead
 *   `require` (the vault's #V8 family, inverted).
 * - THE ENGLISH SOURCE STRING IS THE KEY. Tabby's missing-translation
 *   handler compiles the key itself when no translation exists, so every UI
 *   string in this plugin's code is written in English and the tables below
 *   translate it. A user in an uncovered locale sees English, never French.
 */

/**
 * Covered languages, by Tabby locale code — the vault's three, plus zh-CN.
 *
 * Locale codes, not language codes: Tabby tells `en-US` from `en-GB`; an
 * entry under `fr` would never be found. `en-US` is deliberately absent —
 * our source strings ARE the English; registering an identity table would
 * make the locale exist in `translate.langs`, which is exactly what the
 * `merge()` comment below explains must not happen.
