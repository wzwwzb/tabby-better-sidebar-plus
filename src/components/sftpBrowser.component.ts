     * the mode read for the download came from `stat()` and was 0, so the local
     * copy was created read-only and the editor could not save; the mode
     * restored after an upload was the *link's* (`0o120777`), so the file came
     * back world-writable; and the freshness check compared the link's size and
     * date, which never move when the target changes, so conflict detection was
     * dead. Writing to the resolved path settles all three, and has a fourth
     * effect worth stating: `SFTPSession.upload()` unlinks its target before
     * renaming over it, so editing "through" the link used to replace it with a
     * regular file. It no longer touches the link at all.
