     * What that settles, so it is not rediscovered as a bug: nothing here can
     * touch a session that is already running. Everything written goes to the
     * profile's configuration, which Tabby reads only when a session starts.
     * Acting on a live session would mean calling
     * `SSHSession.addPortForward()`, which calls `fw.startLocalListener()` and
     * therefore needs a genuine `ForwardedPort` — a class tabby-ssh does not
     * export at runtime (checked against the installed bundle, piège #13).
     * Rebuilding one from an existing forward's prototype would only work once
     * the user already had a tunnel, which is circular.
     *
     * The form itself — draft, validation, add/edit/remove — lives in
     * `TunnelsModalComponent` (a centred modal, like the snippets and note
     * editors) rather than in the anchored popup it used to be. What stays
     * here is what the modal cannot know on its own: whether a given forward
     * is one Tabby currently has mounted (`isTunnelLive`, fed by the same
     * poll that drives the tree's own "Tunnels actifs" section) and whether
     * the profile has a live session at all — both handed to the modal as
     * callbacks bound to `profile` below, rather than as a one-time snapshot,
     * so they stay accurate even if a session opens or closes while the modal
     * is open.
