 * The one call this plugin makes to `getProfileGroups()`, clone included.
 *
 * The clone is not a precaution one may skip. `buildGroupTree()` writes
 * `group.children = []` straight onto the objects it is handed; if those are
 * live references into `config.store.groups`, that computed array is serialized
 * into `config.yaml` at the next `config.save()` — any save, a favourite is
 * enough — and the file comes back with duplicated and orphaned groups. That is
 * piège #12, and it corrupted the user's real configuration once.
 *
 * Two callers used to spell the same three lines, the second one right after
 * the `await`, with a comment each explaining the danger. Nothing enforced it:
 * a third caller written next year would compile, run, and quietly poison the
 * config. Spelling it once removes the discipline instead of documenting it —
 * the same move `isSSHTab()` made for `instanceof SSHTabComponent`.
 *
 * **Do not call `profilesService.getProfileGroups()` anywhere else.**

 *
 * As of Tabby 1.0.231-nightly the guarantee happens to hold —
 * `getSyncProfileGroups()` returns `deepClone(config.store.groups)`, and an
 * identity comparison on the running app confirms not one group comes back as
 * the same object. So the `structuredClone()` above is, today, a belt over
 * braces. It stays: the braces are an implementation detail of a method nobody
 * exported, and the failure it guards against is a corrupted config file.
 *
 * What this adds is the missing half — noticing if that ever changes. Identity,
 * not equality, is the question: `getProfileGroups()` sets `editable` and
 * `profiles` on whatever it returns, so a shared object is *not* a copy of the
 * stored one, and comparing values would find differences that prove nothing.
 *
 * Nothing is broken when this fires, which is why it does not reach the user:
 * the clone catches it. It is the plugin's own note that an assumption written
 * in a comment has gone back to being live.
