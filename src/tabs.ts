 * the same objects, so this test goes false for tabs that plainly are SSH tabs
 * — silently, forever, taking the active sessions list, the SFTP view and the
 * tunnels with it (piège #34). The class name still matches in that state, and
 * that disagreement is the only thing that can be observed from here.
 *
 * `constructor.name` survives Tabby's production build: its bundle is minified
 * but keeps class names — the plugin already leans on this to find components
 * from the CDP console. If a future build did mangle them, this probe would
 * simply stop reporting, never misreport: a mangled name matches nothing.

 * `open` flag is never cleared — the installed bundle assigns
 * `this.open = false` exactly once, in the constructor, and `destroy()` only
 * emits `willDestroy` and disconnects. A session killed by a dropped link
 * therefore claims to be open for as long as the object lives.
 *
 * `session` is the shell, which Tabby nulls out on session end
 * (`onSessionDestroyed()` → `setSession(null)`). That is the honest answer to
 * "is this session live", and it is what the tab's own reconnect banner keys
 * off.
 *
 * Shared rather than copied into each caller: the active-sessions list and the
 * SFTP panel had drifted apart on exactly this question — one dropping a row
 * the other still offered an SFTP view for.
