/**
 * Adapters letting `SFTPSession.download()`/`.upload()` read and write a plain
 * local file.
 *
 * Those two methods take a `FileDownload`/`FileUpload`, and the only
 * implementations Tabby ships come from `PlatformService.startDownload()` and
 * `.startUpload()` — both of which pop a file picker. The edit round-trip needs
 * neither dialog: it knows exactly which temporary file it wants. Subclassing
 * rather than duck-typing is required, since `FileTransfer` is an abstract
 * class with private state, so a structurally identical object would not be
 * assignable.
 *
 * Going through `SFTPSession.upload()` rather than writing the remote file
 * directly is deliberate: it writes to `<path>.tabby-upload` first, so a
 * transfer interrupted halfway never leaves a truncated file on the server.
 *
 * It is not, however, atomic, and the difference matters: the sequence is
 * `unlink(path)` *then* `rename(temp, path)`, so a break between the two leaves
 * nothing at all, and the target's identity is replaced on every save — which
 * is what destroys a symlink rather than writing through it (see the roadmap's
 * chantier on editing through a symlink).

// Both classes stick to the members common to the npm typings and the app

// the newer helpers compiles against the old typings and runs against the new
// class. The progress helpers are no loss anyway — these transfers are not
// registered with any Tabby UI, so nothing would read them.
