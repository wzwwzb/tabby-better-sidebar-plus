/**
 * The one place this plugin hands a profile to Tabby's own edit modal.
 *
 * Two callers used to open it and assign its two inputs by hand — "Nouveau
 * profil…" and "Éditer…". Both were correct, and neither could be checked:
 * `src/tabby-settings-augment.d.ts` declares those field names because the
 * published typings are a version behind, so TypeScript takes the plugin's word
 * for it. Angular takes it too — assigning an unknown property to an instance
 * is perfectly legal. A Tabby release that renamed either field would compile
 * clean here and open an empty modal there, with nothing logged on the way.
 *
 * Naming them once is what makes the failure checkable: the list below is both
 * what `openProfileModal()` assigns and what the precondition verifies, so the
 * two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * **This does not make the plugin compatible with a Tabby that renamed them.**
 * It turns "empty modal, no explanation" into a message at startup and a refusal
 * to open — the same trade `hostCompat.ts` makes for the couplings it covers.

 * in the npm typings of Angular 15.2.10, and present as an exported
 * `function reflectComponentType` in the bundle Tabby actually loads.
 *
 * **Read `propName`, never `templateName`** — and do not take Angular's own
 * documentation for it, whose example has the two the wrong way round. The
 * implementation (`toRefArray` over the table `invertObject` built) puts the
 * property name in `propName` and the public name in `templateName`, and the
 * distinction is the whole point here: the modal declares
 * `@Input('profile') partialProfile`, so it is `profile` that keys the raw
 * table. A check written against `templateName` — or against `ɵcmp.inputs`
 * directly — would look for `partialProfile` where the string `profile` sits,
 * and would have failed on a perfectly healthy Tabby, every single start.
 * Measured on the installed app: `[['partialProfile', 'profile'],
